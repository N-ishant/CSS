    <!-- 
        (.) CSS Gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
        (.) To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops.Color stops are the
            colors you want to render smooth transitions among.You can also set a starting point and 
            a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
