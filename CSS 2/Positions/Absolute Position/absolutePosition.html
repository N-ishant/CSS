    <!-- 
        (1) An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the "nearest positioned ancestor".
        (2) Nearest Positioned Ancestor : When referring to nearest positioned ancestor we mean the 
            closest ancestor to the element with a set position value, "other that static(which is default)".
        (3) However, if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document
            body, and moves along with page scrolling.
        (4) Note : Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elemnets.
